# dictionary_hashing
This is the C++ implementation of Dictionary using Hash Tables
The code has been written from scratch by Himanshu Singal.
Object Oriented approach is used.
The main file is testdictionary.cpp which consists of the guide to use the dictionary.h header.
Linear Probing,Double Hashing and Chaining are the collision techniques used.User is free to choose any technique.

Description of various files

testdictionary.cpp is the implementaion file
inventory.h consists of the record class which has to be inserted in dictionary.
dictionary_hash.h is the header file for dictionary
openhashing.h is the header file for hashing with collision method linear probing and double hashing
chainhashing.h is for hashing using chaining as collision avoiding technique.
hashing.h is for calculating the hash code map and mapping key to an index
primegen.h is for finding the prime number next to a given prime number
linkedlist.h is for the linked list using chaining(templates has been used)
linearlist.h is for the seqential list(templates has been used).
